        {
            "committee_name": "Commission on the Status of Women (CSW)",
            "committee_image": "women.jpg",
            "committee_bio": "The Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is the primary intergovernmental body dedicated to promoting gender equality and womenâ€™s rights. The functional commission was established as part of the Economic and Social Commission (ECOSOC) in 1946 to address growing concerns about the United Nationsâ€™ ability to focus on gender equality. In March 2024, the 68th session of the commission will take place addressing how women in marginalized groups can achieve economic empowerment in the 21st century. \nFor the purposes of this committee, the first topic addresses how to economically empower women in rural areas. Rural women are often the most economically disenfranchised and overlooked groups in their country. Delegates will have to grapple with how to create policies that enhance rural womenâ€™s access to social, legal, and economic services as well as how they can utilize leadership opportunities, entrepreneurship, and community participation to bolster their economic status. The second topic focuses on migrant women, another marginalized group facing increasingly difficult economic barriers. Migrant women often go under-compensated for their work because of a lack of immigration status or uncompensated homework. The third topic will focus on providing resources to eradicate maternal mortality, an issue prevalent among women in poverty. Maternal mortality, an issue found particularly in developing countries, is a pressing concern as the alarming rates of maternal deaths during pregnancy continue to rise due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Delegates are tasked with the responsibility of creating methods that will ensure quality access to universal maternal healthcare with the common goal of reducing maternal mortality rates. The UN possesses the ability to bring countries together to collaborate to uplift women economically when they are either forced or make the brave decision to leave their home country. This committee gives delegates the special opportunity to discuss critical issues regarding the equity and economic empowerment of marginalized women across the globe.",

            "chair_bio": "Hi everyone!\r\nIâ€™m Jyotsna and I am so excited to be your head chair for the Commission on the Status of Women. Iâ€™m currently a senior at Virginia Tech double majoring in economics and international relations with minors in French and data science. Iâ€™ve been involved in MUN since my sophomore year of college and am currently my teamâ€™s GA training chair. Iâ€™ve always loved GAâ€™s ability to have young people consider intricate solutions to real-world problems, and I feel like itâ€™s not something that happens in many other settings. Prior to college I did a lot of debate and speech in high school with NSDA and loved it. Apart from MUN, I am also co-president and founder of VTâ€™s chapter of Amnesty International, so I always enjoy talking about issues of equity and policy improvements! In my free time, I love reading, journaling, watching Netflix shows, doing henna, and making Spotify playlists (especially if they involve BeyoncÃ©). I am thrilled to have been able to create a committee I feel so passionate about, and I look forward to seeing you all there!\r\n",
